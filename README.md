## 🆕 What's New in v2.2.0

### ⚡ Tactical Observation Toasts
Real-time event-driven alerts appear as a notification bar above the decode table:
- **Hidden pileup detection** — warns when you see few callers locally but PSK Reporter shows heavy competition at the target's end ("⚠️ Hidden pileup: 1 caller locally, 7 at target's end — you can't hear your competition")
- **Path change alerts** — instant notification when your signal is first heard by the target ("🎯 VK3ABC has decoded YOU — call now!") or when a path opens/closes
- **Competition shifts** — alerts when competition at the target increases or drops significantly
- Rate-limited (1 per 15s) and auto-dismissing (8s) to avoid distraction

### 📊 Pileup Contrast Intelligence
The Insights panel now cross-references local and target-side competition:
- Shows PSK Reporter competition count alongside your local pileup view
- **Hidden pileup warning** — highlighted alert when you see a clear band locally but the target is buried in callers you can't hear
- Feeds into strategy recommendations — "WAIT" instead of "CALL NOW" when hidden competition is heavy

### 🔍 Smarter Predictions
Improved data consistency across all displays:
- **Effective path status** — when PSK Reporter says "No Path" but Path Intelligence shows stations from your area getting through, recommendations now account for this evidence instead of being pessimistic
- **Local decode competition** — when PSK Reporter has no perspective data, the app now counts callers visible in your local decodes instead of showing "Unknown"
- **Target-side competition** feeds into success prediction and strategy recommendations for more accurate advice

### 📋 Column Header Tooltips
Hover over any column header in the decode table to see what it means and where the data comes from (e.g., "Propagation status to this station. Sources: PSK Reporter spots + local decode analysis.")

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
- **Path status logic fix** — "Not Reported in Region" was incorrectly matching as "Reported in Region" due to substring collision, causing wrong colors, wrong path status, and wrong recommendations across 4 code locations
- **Path Intelligence reconciliation** — Path column and Path Intelligence widget now cross-reference each other's data sources instead of showing contradictory information
- **Toast bar readability** — proper sizing and font weight for legibility
- **Band map label spacing** — "Your decodes" label repositioned for clear visual separation

## The Problem

You're calling a DX station. No response. Is the band dead? Is your signal too weak? Or are you buried under a pileup you can't even hear?

Traditional tools show the band from **your** perspective. QSO Predictor shows you **the DX station's** perspective.

## The Solution

Using real-time PSK Reporter data, QSO Predictor shows:
- **What the target is hearing** — signals arriving at their location
- **How crowded each frequency is** — at their end, not yours
- **Whether your signal path is open** — before you call
- **Who else from your area is getting through** — and why

## Quick Start

### Windows
1. Download latest `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/wu2c-peter/qso-predictor/releases)
2. Extract and run `QSO Predictor.exe`
3. Configure WSJT-X/JTDX: Settings → Reporting → UDP Server = `127.0.0.1`, Port = `2237`

### macOS / Linux (from source)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wu2c-peter/qso-predictor.git
cd qso-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_v2.py
```

### First-Time Setup
1. **File → Settings** — enter your callsign and grid
2. **Tools → Bootstrap Behavior** — analyze your logs for behavior prediction (optional but recommended)

## Features

### Target Perspective Band Map
See what the DX station hears, color-coded by data quality:
- **Cyan** — Target is directly decoding these signals
- **Blue tiers** — Nearby stations (proxy data)
- **Count numbers** — Signal density (1-3 ideal, 6+ crowded)

### Path Status
Your signal's reach, at a glance:
- **Heard by Target** — Target has decoded YOUR signal — call now!
- **Heard in Region** — Stations near the target heard you — path confirmed
- **Not Heard in Region** — Reporters exist but haven't heard you yet
- **Not Transmitting** — You haven't transmitted recently
- **No Reporters in Region** — No PSK Reporter data from that area
- **Analyze button** — Deep dive into why others succeed

### Local Intelligence
Predicts DX station behavior from observed patterns:
- **Loudest First** — favors strong signals
- **Methodical** — works through pileup systematically  
- **Random/Fair** — no clear preference

### Hunt Mode
Never miss a wanted station:
- Track by callsign, prefix, or country
- Desktop notifications when spotted
- Special alerts when working your area

### Smart Frequency Recommendations
- **Green line** — Algorithm's recommended TX frequency
- **Score graph** — Visual scoring across the band
- **Solid vs dotted** — Confidence indicator (proven vs estimated)
